Fakebook
=============

Facebook platform simulator, to aid in developing Facebook canvas apps offline. Takes a request 
and passes it to the app as a POST with the fb_sig_* params added, etc. Returns the response 
with FBML parsed (sort of) and some chrome added.

To use, run 'fakebook' from the command line to start up a Fakebook proxy. For example, if you 
have an app running on port 3000, and the callback path is "/facebook/", and the canvas path 
is "myapp", you'd run:

  $ fakebook --callback "http://localhost:3000/facebook/" --canvas "/myapp/"

Fakebook will also look for a config file at "./config/fakebook.yml", so you can put one in 
your project and save some typing. The file should look like this:

  callback: "http://localhost:3000/callback-path/"
  canvas:   "/canvas-path/"
  secret:   345345jk4jkhfpo2390s
  user:     123435567
  session:  345345jk4jkhfpo2390s
  friends:  "10,11,12"
  host:     0.0.0.0
  port:     6000

See "fakebook --help" for more options.

You can also use the library directly with the Fakebook class:

  require 'fakebook'
	app = Fakebook.new :callback  => "http://localhost:3000/callback-path/",
	                   :canvas    => "/myapp/",
	                   :secret    => "app-secret",
	                   :fb_params => { :user => 123, :session_key => 'abc', :friends => "345,456" }
	app.request("/")


Because Fakebook implements #call according to the Rack specification [1], you can create an 
HTTP server that proxies to your application using your choice of server library (Mongrel, 
WEBrick, Thin, etc.) For example:

  Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run app, :Port => 5000
