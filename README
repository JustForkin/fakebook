Fakebook
=============

Lightly simulates the Facebook platform, allowing you to develop apps offline. Takes a 
request and passes it to the app as a POST with the fb_sig_* params added, etc. Returns 
the response with FBML parsed (sort of) and some chrome added. For example:

	app = Fakebook.new :callback_url => "http://0.0.0.0:4000/facebook/",
	                   :canvas_path  => "/myapp/",
	                   :app_secret   => "app-secret",
	                   :fb_params    => { :user => 123, :session_key => 'abc', :friends => "345,456" }
	app.request("/").body

Because Fakebook implements #call according to the Rack specification, you can simply 
create an HTTP server that proxies to your application, using your choice of server 
library (Mongrel, WEBrick, Thin, etc.) For example:

  Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run app, :Port => 5000
