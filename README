Fakebook
=============

Lightly simulates the Facebook platform, allowing you to develop apps offline. Takes a 
request and passes it to the app as a POST with the fb_sig_* params added, etc. Returns 
the response with FBML parsed (sort of) and some chrome added. Requires the Rack library.

For example, to create an HTTP server that simulates the Facebook proxy:

  Fakebook::Proxy.rack "http://0.0.0.0:5000/canvas-path/", 
    "http://0.0.0.0:4000/callback-path/",
    "app-secret", 
    { :user => 512280897, :session_key => 'session-key', :friends => "2,3,4" }

Or you can hit the app directly, without starting a proxy server:

  app = Fakebook::Application.new("http://0.0.0.0:4000/facebook/", "canvas-path", "app-secret")
  app.set_default_params :user => 123, :session_key => 'abc', :friends => "345,456"
  app.request("/").body
