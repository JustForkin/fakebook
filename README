Fakebook
=============

Simple Facebook platform simulator, to aid in developing Facebook canvas apps offline. Takes 
a request and passes it to the app as a POST with the fb_sig_* params added, etc. Returns the 
response with FBML parsed (sort of) and some chrome added.

To use, run 'fakebook' from the command line to start up a Fakebook proxy. For example, if you 
have a Rails app running on port 3000, and the callback path is "/facebook/", and the canvas path 
is "myapp":

  $ fakebook -c "http://0.0.0.0:3000/facebook/" -a "/myapp/"

You can save yourself some typing by creating a file called "config/fakebook.yml", and putting
your configuration in it, like this:

  :callback_url: 'http://whatever/'
  :canvas_path: "/myapp/"
  :app_secret: 345345jk4jkhfpo2390s
  :fb_params:
    :user: 123435567
    :session: 345345jk4jkhfpo2390s
    :friends: "10,11,12"
  :rack:
    :Port: 6000

See "fakebook --help" for more options.


You can also use the library apart from the command line helper with the Facebook class:

  require 'fakebook'
	app = Fakebook.new :callback_url => "http://0.0.0.0:3000/callback-path/",
	                   :canvas_path  => "/myapp/",
	                   :app_secret   => "app-secret",
	                   :fb_params    => { :user => 123, :session_key => 'abc', :friends => "345,456" }
	app.request("/")


Because Fakebook implements #call according to the Rack specification 
(http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html), you can simply create an HTTP server that 
proxies to your application, using your choice of server library (Mongrel, WEBrick, Thin, 
etc.) For example:

  Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run app, :Port => 5000
