Fakebook
=============

Lightly simulates the Facebook platform, allowing you to develop apps offline. Takes a 
request and passes it to the app as a POST with the fb_sig_* params added, etc. Returns 
the response with FBML parsed (sort of) and some chrome added. For example:

	app = Fakebook.new :callback_url   => "http://0.0.0.0:4000/facebook/",
	                   :canvas_path    => "/myapp/",
	                   :app_secret     => "app-secret")
	                   :default_params => { :user => 123, :session_key => 'abc', :friends => "345,456" }
	app.request("/").body

Fakebook implements the #call method according to the Rack specification, so you can simply 
use them to create an HTTP server that proxies to your application, using your choice of 
HTTP server library (Mongrel, WEBrick, Thin, etc.) For example:

  Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run app, :Port => 5000
