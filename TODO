- better logging -- use rack's logger when the proxy is used; otherwise pass in a logger to Application?
- get rid of Fakebook::Proxy.rack -- the mongrel-specific stuff should be elsewhere, like in the bin
- is there a ruby way of doing the benchmarking stuff?

   #start_time = Time.now
   #...
   #end_time = Time.now
   #STDERR.puts "[#{end_time - start_time}] #{path}"

- allow for a template to be specified when initializing Fakebook::Proxy -- even pass in your own full path?
- the "Starting Fakebook proxy..." thing probably belongs in the bin
- make the command-line UI friendlier
- better getting-started docs
- accept a yaml file to set up default_params, as well as other facebook-knowledge
- the set_default_params thing sucks
- parse fbml better
   - if-is-user
   - is-logged-out
   - iframe
   - profile-pic
   - comments
   - possessive names
   - share_button
- respond to regular API requests?
