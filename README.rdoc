= Fakebook

Fakebook simulates the Facebook platform, to aid in developing Facebook canvas apps offline. 
It takes a request and passes it to the app as a POST with the fb_sig_* params added, etc. 
The response is returned with FBML parsed (sort of) and some chrome added.

In other words: you can work on Facebook canvas apps when you're on a plane.

To use, run 'fakebook' from the command line to start up a Fakebook proxy. For example, if you 
have an app running on port 3000, and the callback path is "/", and the canvas path 
is "myapp", you would run:

  $ fakebook --callback="http://localhost:3000/" --canvas="myapp"

See "fakebook --help" for more options. By default, Fakebook will look for a config file at 
./config/fakebook.yml. The file should look like this:

  callback: http://localhost:3000/
  canvas:   myapp
  secret:   secret
  user:     1
  session:  session_key
  friends:  2, 3, 4
  host:     0.0.0.0
  port:     5000

You can also use the library directly with the Fakebook class, which eases testing:

  require 'fakebook'
  app = Fakebook.new :callback  => "http://localhost:3000/",
                     :canvas    => "myapp",
                     :secret    => "secret",
                     :fb_params => { :user => 1, :session_key => 'session_key', :friends => [2, 3, 4] }
  app.request("/")

Because Fakebook implements #call according to the Rack 
specification[http://rack.rubyforge.org/doc/files/SPEC.html], you can create an HTTP server 
that proxies to your application using your choice of server library (Mongrel, WEBrick, Thin, 
etc.) For example:

  require 'fakebook'
  app = Fakebook.new # etc...
  Rack::Handler::Mongrel.run app, :Port => 5000
